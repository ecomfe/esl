    <h1>Dynamic Plugin Test</h1>
    <p>Tests a plugin that has plugin.dynamic set to true, and it is used as
    part of require('') call that needs to be found via Function.prototype.toString
    dependency scanning. The dynamic plugin should only be called once in this case,
    not one time for the dependency to pass to the function and then another for
    the require call inside the function.</p>
    <p>Check console for messages</p>
